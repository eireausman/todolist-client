To Do List using:

Server: - Express - Mongoose (with MongoDB backend)

Client: - React - Typescript

Objective:

I wanted to go through creating the 'To Do List' again, but using a different set of coding tools/packages.

The original To Do List project was completed as part of the Odin Project. It was written in plain JS and I struggled to keep the file sizes contained. There is just a lot of verbose JS required to create views and provide the required functionality.

I also found it challenging to debug.

I wanted to do the same piece of work again so I could compare the two. This would help me understand how the tooling makes things simpler (in a lot of cases at least) and how my skills have developed in the past couple of months.
